Mercury
=======

Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in the solar system. It has a rocky surface covered with craters and no atmosphere to speak of.

Because it orbits so close to the Sun, Mercury experiences extreme temperature variations. Daytime temperatures can reach 430°C, while nights plunge to -180°C.

Despite its proximity to Earth, Mercury is difficult to observe due to its closeness to the Sun. Most of what we know comes from spacecraft like Mariner 10 and MESSENGER.

**Quick Facts:**

- Diameter: 4,879 km
- Orbital Period: 88 Earth days
