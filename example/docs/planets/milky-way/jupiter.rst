Jupiter
=======

Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system and is known for its massive size and iconic Great Red Spot. It is a gas giant composed mostly of hydrogen and helium.

Its strong magnetic field and dozens of moons make it a miniature solar system in its own right. The four largest moons—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto—are known as the Galilean moons.

Jupiter's atmosphere features colorful bands and storms that can last for centuries. The planet emits more heat than it receives from the Sun, due to internal processes.
