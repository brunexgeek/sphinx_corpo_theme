Lifecycle of Stars
==================

Stars are born in nebulae—vast clouds of gas and dust. Under the influence of gravity, these clouds collapse to form protostars.

As the core temperature rises, nuclear fusion ignites, and the star enters the main sequence phase, where it spends most of its life.

Eventually, the star exhausts its hydrogen fuel. Depending on its mass, it may become a red giant or supergiant, and later evolve into a white dwarf, neutron star, or black hole.
