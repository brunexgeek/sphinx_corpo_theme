Types of Stars
==============

Stars are classified by their spectral type and temperature. The main types are O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, with O being the hottest and M the coolest.

Red dwarfs are the most common type of star in the universe. They are small, cool, and long-lived. Our Sun is a G-type yellow dwarf.

Blue giants are massive and short-lived, often ending their lives in spectacular supernovae. White dwarfs are the remnants of low-mass stars.

.. note::

   The nearest star to Earth is Proxima Centauri, a red dwarf.
