Detecting Black Holes
=====================

Although black holes emit no light, we can detect them through indirect methods. One way is by observing the motion of stars orbiting an invisible mass.

Gravitational lensing occurs when a black hole bends the light of objects behind it, creating arcs or rings.

X-ray emissions from accretion disks—hot gas spiraling into the black hole—are another telltale sign.
