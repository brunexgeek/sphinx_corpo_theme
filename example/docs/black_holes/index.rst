Black Holes
===========

Black holes are regions of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing—not even light—can escape. They are among the most mysterious objects in the universe.

This section explores how black holes form and how we detect them. Despite being invisible, their presence can be inferred through their effects on nearby matter.

Black holes come in different sizes, from stellar-mass to supermassive, and may reside at the centers of most galaxies.
