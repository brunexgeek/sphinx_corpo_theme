Formation of Black Holes
=========================

Black holes typically form from the remnants of massive stars that undergo gravitational collapse after exhausting their nuclear fuel.

If the core's mass exceeds the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, it collapses into a singularity—a point of infinite density.

There are also theories about primordial black holes formed in the early universe and intermediate-mass black holes formed through stellar mergers.
