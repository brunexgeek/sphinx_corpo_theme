Comets
======

Comets are icy bodies that originate from the outer regions of the solar system. When they approach the Sun, their ices vaporize, creating a glowing coma and tail.

They are thought to be remnants from the early solar system, preserving ancient materials that can offer clues about planetary formation.

Comets follow elliptical orbits and can be periodic (like Halley's Comet) or long-period, visiting the inner solar system only once every few thousand years.
